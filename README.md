# Personal Portofolio

A mesmerizing personal portofolio made with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Portofolio website comprised of four pages that are interlinked with each other. This website uses Bulma framework to help with it's designing. Each pages is designed around each other and have similar theme, which is simple and modern with accents of pink and purple. Website is made of home page/profile, projects, experience, and contact page.

My portofolio website is built around expandibilty and allowing for new projects and experiences that I will naturally collect and make to be put inside it without minimal issues. Projects can be catagorized and searched up while experience can be added to the timeline seamlessly. With ractive and receptive buttons and interaction, this website will certainly be an eye-candy.
